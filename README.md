# JCU Introduction to Data Science Repository

Welcome! This repository serves as the host for all files that make up the JCU Introduction to Data Science Jupyter Book 
and all the labs provided in the book as both .ipynb and .Rmd files, located in the Student Labs folder.
The necessary csv file to each lab is available in the lab folder it corresponds to. If the lab does not have a csv file, 
it does not require one.
